# Vertical â†‘

Vertical aims to provide management solutions for businesses and non-profit organizations, large or small. 

Version 1.0 of Vertical will be designed for small businesses and organizations with multiple locations and employees that are looking to manage their contact/client relationships, invoicing, manage a schedule, fundraise, and track income and expenses with some light accounting features.
