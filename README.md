# Vertical â†‘

More than just another e-commerce system, Vertical aims to go further with organization management solutions for merchants, service providers, and non-profits, large or small.   

Version 1.0 of Vertical will be designed for small businesses or organizations with one location and multiple employees that are looking to manage their contact/client relationships, record product sales and service fulfillment, manage a schedule, and track income and expenses with some light accounting features.

If you would like to contribute and join our discussion as a Software Developer, UI/UX Designer, Project Manager, or as someone in business looking to eventually expand it to their industry, feel free to join our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/verticalcrew/shared_invite/enQtOTM0Nzc4NzQwNzY4LTJlNzUyOThiMTZlNzIyYTBhOWI0Zjc2NzliZGY0N2FmMDRhYmYxZTQwN2ZhYjYwYjQ1MmI1MjMwNDA0Nzc1ODA).
