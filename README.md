# Vertical â†‘

More than just another e-commerce system, Vertical aims to go further with management solutions for businesses, large or small.   

Version 1.0 of Vertical will be designed for small businesses with one location and multiple employees that are looking to manage their contact/client relationships, sell their products and services at the point of sale, manage a schedule, and track income and expenses with some light accounting features.

If you would like to join this discussion as a software developer or as someone in business looking to eventually expand it to their industry, feel free to join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/verticalcrew/shared_invite/enQtOTM0Nzc4NzQwNzY4LTJlNzUyOThiMTZlNzIyYTBhOWI0Zjc2NzliZGY0N2FmMDRhYmYxZTQwN2ZhYjYwYjQ1MmI1MjMwNDA0Nzc1ODA) here.
